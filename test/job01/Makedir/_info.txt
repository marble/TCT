This folder 'Makedir/' and all files and folders within need to
be world writable.

The toolchain 'RenderDocumentation' requires this 'makedir' folder.

The toolchain reads the settings of './buildsettings.sh'
and expects './conf.py' to exist.

The toolchain creates file './build.checksum' and others named './temp_*'.

conf-2017-09.py is
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TYPO3-Documentation/typo3-docs-typo3-org-resources/master/userroot/scripts/bin/conf-2017-09.py
as of today (2019-05-23). It is here for information and comparison with
conf.py only. conf.py initially is a copy of conf-2017-09.py but may be updated
and modified here for the purpose of this Docker image.

_htaccess is
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TYPO3-Documentation/typo3-docs-typo3-org-resources/master/userroot/scripts/config/_htaccess-2016-08.txt
and a fresh download is made at build time.

The toolchain 'RenderDocumentation' is more and more being
modified to accept all needed parameters from the commandline.
Therefore in future the 'makedir' folder may not be necessary
any more.

End.
